# Salmorejo
Created 12 Mar 2020

## Ingredients

- 8 medium tomatoes (Note that this dish is *very* sensitive to the quality of the tomatoes)
- 1 medium baguette
- 1 c extra-virgin olive oil (similarly, this dish is sensitive to quality)
- 1 clove garlic
- Dash of sherry vinegar (may substitute red wine vinegar)
- Salt to taste
- 2 hardboiled eggs
- Serrano ham or prosciutto for serving

## Instructions

1. *Scald the tomatoes:* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut a small cross in the bottom of each tomato and drop into the boiling water for **30-60 seconds**. Remove and immediately place in an icewater bath. Peel the tomatoes.
2. *First blend:* Discard the tomato cores and add the tomatoes to the blender. Blend at high speed for about **30 seconds** until fully broken down.
3. *Add bread:* Remove the innards from the baguette and add them to the blended tomatoes. The baguette should have rendered 2-3 c of innard, and the exact amount added may be adjusted to achieve the desired consistency. Allow the bread to soak in the tomato juice for about **5 minutes**.
4. *Second blend:* Add the vinegar, salt, and garlic. Blend until the soup is an even texture and the bread is completely broken down.
5. *Add oil:* Slowly add the olive oil while blending at a moderate speed.
6. *Add egg and adjust:* Add one hardboiled egg and blend until incorporated. Taste and adjust levels of salt, vinegar, garlic, and bread as needed.
7. *Serving:* Serve cold topped with diced hardboiled egg and sliced ham or prosciutto.
