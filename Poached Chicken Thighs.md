# Poached Chicken Thighs
Created 11 Mar 2020

## Ingredients

- 5 lb chicken thighs
- 1 large oñon
- 1 rib celery
- 1 large carrot
- 1 t dried tarragon (may substitute basil, marjoram, herbes de Provence, or thyme as desired)
- 1/4 t black pepper
- salt to taste (optional)

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken thighs in a 6-quart Dutch oven or soup pot
2. Quarter the oñon, roughly cut the celery and carrot, and add all to the pot
3. Sprinkle seasonings into the pot
4. Add just enough water to submerge the chicken and vegetables completely
5. Cover the pot and bring to a **rolling boil** over **high heat**
6. As soon as the water reaches a vigorous boil, reduce the heat to **low** and simmer **uncovered** for **10 minutes**
7. Remove the pot from the heat and let stand **covered** until chicken is done throughout, approximately **25 to 35 minutes**. If using a thermometer (recommended), cook until an internal temperature of **170 ˚F** is reached.
8. Once done, remove the chicken from the pot using tongs or a slotted spoon. Reserve the stock in the pot for later use.
9. Allow the chicken to cool enough to remove the skinn and any visible fat
10. Pull the meat from the bones and cut into small chunks

## Footnotes

1. If using a smaller 4-quart pot, only cook 3 lb of chicken thighs
