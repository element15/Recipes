# Egg Nog
Created Dec 2019

## Ingredients

- 7 eggs, separated
- 7 jiggers (1-1/3 cups) bourbon
- 2 cups milk
- 7 Tbsp (heaping) sugar
- 1 pint heavy cream
- Nutmeg, grated, to float on top of each cup

## Instructions

1. Using a standing or handheld mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks till they are a lemon color.
2. Gradually add bourbon to egg yolks, beating vigorously until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. At a lower speed, whisk milk into the mixture until it resembles loose custard.
3. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites till stiff. Add sugar. Continue beating. Add to yolk mixture. In another bowl, beat cream till stiff. Add to mixture, folding in gradually. Store in refrigerator until serving time.
- "When the eggnog is done, we transfer it to a Tupperware pitcher and store it in the refrigerator until the next day. You can drink it the same day you make it, but the next day the eggnog will have a luscious density with a foamy, meringue-like top, easily reincorporated by stirring with a wooden spoon. Never add ice. Always nutmeg."

## Footnotes
- Makes about 8 servings. To look adequate in a silver punch bowl—and to serve more friends—you need two batches. Don't just double the recipe. Make one batch, clean the utensils, then make a second.
