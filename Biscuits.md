# Biscuits

## Ingredients
- 2 c flour
- 1 T baking powder
- 1/3 c shortening
- 1 c buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to **430 ËšF**

2. Mix baking powder thoroughly into flour while dry.

3. Mix shortening into flour with a fork, stopping when the shortening is still in small clumps.

4. Add buttermilk and mix until a dough ball forms. Lightly knead until all flour is mixed into the ball. Take care not to over-knead, as this will result in tough biscuits.

5. Roll out dough on a dusted surface and cut into biscuits with a biscuit cutter or appropriately-sized glass.

6. Place on dusted sheet pan and bake until golden brown, or to taste. Usually **20 minutes or so**.

## Footnotes
- For biscuits with layers, fold and re-roll the dough sheet a couple of times before cutting out biscuits.
- Biscuit thickness can be adjusted to taste, depending on preferred doneness and crust prevalence.
