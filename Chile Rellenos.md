# Chile Rellenos
Created 15 Feb 2020

## Ingredients
- 6 poblanos (Do not substitute for Anaheim chiles. They will fall apart.)
- Salt/pepper
- 1-1/2 c shredded monterey jack cheese
- 1 T dried oregano, preferably Mexican
- 5 large egg whites plus 2 egg yolks at room temperature
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- All-purpose flour, for dredging
- Sauce
	- 1 35-oz can plum tomatoes, drained
	- 1 small white oñon, chopped
	- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
	- Hot peppers, to taste (about 2 jalapeños)
	- 3 T extra-virgin olive oil
	- Chile powder, to taste
	- Oregano, to taste

## Instructions
1. *Peel the peppers*
	1. Char the peppers under the broiler until blackened
	2. Transfer the peppers to a plastic bag and close. Let stand for **10 minutes** to steam the peppers, making them soft and easy to peel.
	3. Gently rub the peppers with paper towels to remove the skin. It's okay if a few flecks of skin remain. Do not rinse after peeling.
	4. Cut a slit along the length of the pepper and remove the seeds and inner membranes.
2. *Sauce* -- Puree the tomatoes, oñon, garlic, and hot peppers in a blender until smooth. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add puree and simmer for **5 minutes**, stirring occasionally. The sauce will be broth-ey. Season with salt, pepper, chile powder, and oregano and keep warm.
3. *Filling* -- Place the cheese in a bowl. Add the oregano, crumbling and rubbing it to release its flavor. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
4. *Stuff the peppers* -- Fill each pepper with the cheese mixture. Fold in the sides to cover the filling, then thread toothpicks in an X-pattern across the opening to hold it shut while frying. Do not over-fill.
5. *Batter* -- Beat the egg whites with a mixer on high until soft peaks form. Add one egg yolk and beat for 3 more minutes.
6. *Fry*
	1. Heat an inch of oil in a deep skillet to **375 ˚F**
	2. Pour flour into a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Coat the stuffed chiles with the flour.
	3. Batter each chile and allow the excess to drip off.
	4. Fry chiles **1-2 minutes per side**, flipping once. Drain on paper towels.

- Modifications:
	- 17 Feb 2020: Found an alternate tomato sauce recipe. The one included with the original recipe turned out a bit bland, though it may have been because of poor quality tomatoes. Increased the number of eggs for the batter. Three egg whites + one yolk was not enough. Added a note not to substitute poblanos for Anaheim chiles.
