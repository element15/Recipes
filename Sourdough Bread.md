# Sourdough Bread
Created 19 July 2020

## Starter
- Maintain starter at approximately 50% hydration
- Feed with equal parts flour and tepid water
- All-purpose or bread flour may be used
- Feeding should roughly double the amount of starter. For example, if you have 140 g of starter which needs to be fed, and want 100 g of starter for a recipe:
	- Pour off all but 70-80 g of starter
	- Add 40 g of flour and 40 g of water
	- Allow starter to rise
	- Remove 100 g for use
- Duration between feeding
	- If starter is kept at room temperature, it should be fed every day, or twice a day if the starter is particularly strong
	- Starter may be refrigerated to allow for approximately a week between feedings. Make sure to allow the starter to warm up to room temperature before feeding. If refrigerating, do so immediately after feeding.

## Instructions
1. Knead all ingredients together until roughly combined. Cover and autolyse for about an hour.
2. Knead thoroughly. Cover and leave to proof for 2-5 hours at room temperature or (preferably) overnight in the refrigerator. Proofing time will vary significantly depending on ambient conditions.
3. If dough was proofed in the refrigerator, remove and allow to warm up to room temperature.
4. Shape dough into desired loaf shape. Cover in a well-floured towel and proof a second time, following steps 2 and 3 as before.
5. Preheat oven to **450 ËšF** with the bread pan/stone on the top rack (positioned roughly in the center) and an aluminum sheet pan on the lower rack.
6. Dust preheated cooking surface with cornmeal and turn dough out onto it.
7. Score bread, place in the oven, and immediately pour a cupful of boiling water into the hot aluminum pan and close the oven door. Do not open the oven door for at least the first fifteen minutes of baking.
8. Bake until golden, about half an hour
9. Allow loaf to cool on a cooling rack completely before slicing
