## Instructions

1. Curry Paste
	1. Halve, deseed, and roughly chop chilies. Peel the garlic and ginger.
	2. Put a frying pan over medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant, then remove from heat.
	3. Add the toasted spices to a food processor and blitz into a powder.
	4. Add all remaining paste ingredients to the food processor and blitz to a smooth paste. Put aside.
2. Finely slice the oñons, pepper, and ginger. Seperate the cilantro leaves from the stalks. Finely chop the stalks and roughly chop the leaves. Set leaves aside for garnish.
3. Place a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add a bit of oil. Add the oñons, pepper, ginger, and cilantro stalks, then cook for around **10 minutes**, or until softened and lightly golden.
4. Slice the chicken breasts lengthwise into inch-long strips. Add the chicken and about a quarter cup of the tikka masala paste, stirring well to coat.
5. Season with salt and pepper, then add the tomatoes and coconut milk. Bring everything to a light boil.
6. Turn heat down and simmer covered for **20 minutes**, then remove lid and simmer for another **5 minutes**, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally.
7. Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yogurt, and a splash of lemon juice.
