## Ingredients

List the ingredients as a bulleted list here. Two good ways to order this list are by approximate order of use in the recipe, or by ingredient type (e.g. listing all spices together).

Abbreviations:
- Volume:
    - t: Teaspoon
	- T: Tablespoon
	- oz: Ounce
	- c: Cup
	- pt: Pint
	- Qt: Quart
	- Gal: Gallon
- Mass:
    - g: Gram
	- kg: Kilogram
	- oz: Ounce
	- lb: Pound

Fractions should be denoted by a slash. Mixed numbers should be denoted by the whole number and fraction with a single space in between. A couple of examples:
- 1/2
- 3/4
- 2 1/2
- 1 1/4
Where practical, fractions should be preferred over decimals.

Ingredient names should not be capitalized unless they are proper nouns. There should be no punctuation between the number, unit, and ingredient names.

## Instructions

Present the instructions as a numbered list. Short, specific instructions should be preferred over more paragraphical explanations. Place cook times, oven temperatues, and other important points in **bold**.

## Footnotes

Where applicable, include the source as a Markdown-formatted link. Notes about alternate preparation methods should also be included down here.
