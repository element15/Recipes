# Tortilla Espa単ola
Created 12 Mar 2020

## Ingredients

- 1 kg potatoes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 8 large eggs
- 1 o単on
- Olive oil

## Instructions

1. Peel the potatoes and rinse them under cold water. Thinly slice, pat dry, and sprinkle with salt.
2. Heat a half-inch of olive oil in a large frying pan at **medium-low heat**. When oil is hot, add the potatoes (and more oil if necessary) until all are covered. Cook for **20 minutes** at a low heat. It is okay if some of the potatoes break apart.
3. While potatoes are cooking, beat eggs in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper
4. Slice the o単on as thinly as possible (julienne), and fry over a low heat in a separate heavy pan for about **10-20 minutes**, stirring often, until they begin to caramelize
5. Drain the o単ons and add them to the egg mixture
6. Once cooked, drain the potatoes and allow them to rest on a paper towel for a minute or two, then add them to the egg mixture and stir well
7. Allow the egg mixture to sit for about **20 minutes**
8. Remove most of the oil from the pan used to fry the potatoes, then add the egg mixture
9. Cook over medium-low heat for about **6-8 minutes** per side
10. Slide the cooked tortilla out of the pan onto a serving plate and allow to cool before slicing

2. The best method to flip the tortilla when cooking (if using a suitably-shaped pan) is to toss it off the back of the pan into the air. If you are unable or uncomfortable doing this, you can slide the tortilla out of the pan onto a large plate, invert the pan over the plate, and then flip the entire assembly back onto the stovetop.
